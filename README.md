<p>The scrolls utilized by our professional clerics within the Den are designed for user quary and concerns. Information gathered through our scrolls will be delivered to an abyss where only the worthy are permitted to access. The worthy are tested with a riddle that demands a precise speech which will enable them to access all stored scrolls. The answer to the riddle may only be made known to those that the DMs deem worthy.</p>

<p>The scrolls allow the adventurers to communicate with our clerics and DMs regarding concerns such as rigged dice rolls, unfair enemy scaling, fractures in the den's structure and many more.</p>
